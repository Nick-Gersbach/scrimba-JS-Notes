    <title>The Map Method</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- 
      the map method is a quicker/cleaner way of iterating through arrays, it is the more modern way of doing things instead of always using for loops
     -->
    <h1>The map method</h1>

    <!-- 
      The below code is the scrimba price for pro memberships in cents. The numbers are in cents because monetary information is usually held in databases in the smallest denomination possible in real world programming. We are going to use the .map method to convert the data to dollars and also concatenate a dollar sign to the beginning of each number. Again you could use a for loop to do this but the .map method was custom built for this.

      The .map method converts data to strings if if you are adding a character that is not a number
      
      //change to dollars and concatenate a dollar sign at the beginning of each number
      let priceListCents = [3900, 9000, 15000];

      // for (let i = 0; i < energyCostEuros.length; i++) {

        return euroCost * exchangeRate;
