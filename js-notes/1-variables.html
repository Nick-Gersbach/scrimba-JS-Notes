    <h1>JS Variables</h1>
    <!-- 
      - Variables hold information for you using descriptive names.

      - Javascript reads a page from the top down. This means that you wouldn't be able to console.log a variable in your code before the variable has been declared in the code. See the example below

      //This code would throw an error
      console.log(myAge)  
      let myAge = 30;

     -->
    <script>
      //Writing a variable
      let count = 0;
      //printing the variable to the js console
      console.log(count);

      let myAge = 30;
      console.log(myAge);
    </script>
