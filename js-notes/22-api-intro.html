      What is an API?
      
      ////////////////////////


      API = Application Programming Interface or in other words ...

      Any tool that helps connect your program to someone else's program.

      This of it as a restaurant - You and your family (frontned) want the food from the kitchen (backend) and get it by connecting with the waitress (api) who talks to the kitchen and gets the food for you

      - Information for websites is stored in databases all around the world. Web developers use apis to connect with databases and to add information from them onto their own websites in a secure way without having to understand how the backend is working/storing the data. 

      - apis will allow you to access real data from other websites
      - build more interesting apps
      - prepare you to learn full stack development

      Response - The reply to the request with the required information (HTML, Images, CSS. Text data) asked for by the client

      Server code 200 - Everything is ok
