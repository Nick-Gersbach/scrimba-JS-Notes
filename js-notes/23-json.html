    <h1>JSON</h1>

    <!-- 
      JSON is another programming language used to pass and store data.

      JSON = Javascript Object Notation

      JSON files have the .json extension
      
      JSON objects look like regular javascript variables. Make sure your keys in the object jey value pairs are written in double quotes

      JSON Example

      {
        "name": "Nick",
        "age": 30,
        "gender": "male",
        "hobbies": ["lifting", "eating", "sleeping"]
        "sexy": true,
      }

      Almost every json file you see is going to be made up of a single object or an array of objects

      JSON has to be formatted exactly right for it to work. You can use tools like jsonlint.com to make sure you wrote your JSON correctly

      - You can view all of the json that comes into any website in real time by using the developer tools, clicking on network, and XHR

      - Asynchronus means that code runs out of order and top top to bottom. This happens when you use the .then.

      //Making my frst fetch request to get data from a website using json
      fetch("https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random")
        .then((response) => response.json())
        .then((data) => console.log(data));
    </script>
